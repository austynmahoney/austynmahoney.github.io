<a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>If you ask any of my friends, family or colleagues, they will all attest to the fact that I live and breathe Android. I picked it up in its infancy, and have grown along with it ever since.</p>

<p>I love making apps and I am lucky enough to have a career in it. I have been developing Android apps for over 5 years, starting when I was attending <em>Weber State University</em> working towards a degree in <em>Computer Science</em> with an emphasis on <em>Software Engineering</em>.</p>

<h4>
<a name="work-history" class="anchor" href="#work-history"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Work History</h4>

<p>I've worked on my own and on Android development teams at many different companies. I have developed apps ranging from prototypes for a military contractor to a consumer Smart Radio controller app for Logitech (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.logitech.smartradio">link</a>). </p>

<p>I currently work as an Android Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.octanner.com">O.C Tanner</a>, where I develop employee recognition and rewards apps. Check out our <a href="http://www.octanner.com/about-us/careers/">open positions</a> if you think you would enjoy working with some of the smartest people in Utah (I sure do!).</p>

<p>Most of my apps have been B2B, so they have not made it the the Play Store. That will be changing very soon, with the release of some more apps at work and home. Stay tuned!</p>

<h4>
<a name="open-source" class="anchor" href="#open-source"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open Source</h4>

<p>I love working with the Android open source community. I contribute to many open source Android libraries, all which you can see at <a href="https://github.com/austynmahoney" class="user-mention">@austynmahoney</a>.</p>

<p>I work to try to make Android development easier from a tools and OS perspective. I get a lot of help from Google on this (okay, I give them a small fraction of help!). If you are also contributing to Android, you will probably come across my name on a ton of bug reports for AOSP, Android Studio, and the many support libraries. Don't be afraid to say hi!</p>
